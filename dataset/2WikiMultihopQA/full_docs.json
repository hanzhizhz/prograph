      "His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, and the destructive capacity of human nature.",
      "Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as \"Hercules\" (1958) and its sequel \"Hercules Unchained\" (1959)",
      "(each were lampooned on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\").",
      "During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including \"I Vampiri\" (1957) (the first Italian horror film of the sound era), \"The Day the Sky Exploded\" (1958) (the first Italian science fiction film), \"Caltiki – The Immortal Monster\" (1959) and \"The Giant of Marathon\" (1959).",
      "Although most of Bava's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock.",
      "Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres: \"Black Sunday\" (1960), his official directorial debut, was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle; \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\" (1963) is considered to be the first giallo film; \"Kill, Baby, Kill\" (1966) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror; \"Roy Colt & Winchester Jack\" (1970) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns; \"",
      "Four Times That Night\" (1971) was an early Italian sex comedy; and \"A Bay of Blood\" (1971) was a precursor to slasher films.",
      "His other notable films include \"Hercules in the Haunted World\" (1961), \"Erik the Conqueror\" (1961), \"Black Sabbath\" (1963), \"The Whip and the Body\" (1963), \"Blood and Black Lace\" (1964), \"Planet of the Vampires\" (1965), \"Knives of the Avenger\" (1966),  (1968), \"Hatchet for the Honeymoon\" (1970), \"Five Dolls for an August Moon\" (1970), \"Baron Blood\" (1972), \"Lisa and the Devil\" (1974), \"Rabid Dogs\" (1974) and \"Shock\" (1977).",
      "Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime, Bava's shy, self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry, and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood.",
      "Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, Nicolas Winding Refn, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, Joe Dante, John Landis, Francis Ford Coppola, Roger Corman, Edgar Wright, Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino.",

      "He split both major British parties in the course of his career.",
      "Chamberlain made his career in Birmingham, first as a manufacturer of screws",
      "and then as a notable mayor of the city.",
      "He was a radical Liberal Party member and an opponent of the Elementary Education Act 1870 on the basis that it could result in subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers' money.",
      "As a self-made businessman, he had never attended university and had contempt for the aristocracy.",
      "He entered the House of Commons at 39 years of age, relatively late in life compared to politicians from more privileged backgrounds.",
      "Rising to power through his influence with the Liberal grassroots organisation, he served as President of the Board of Trade in Gladstone's Second Government (1880–85).",
      "At the time, Chamberlain was notable for his attacks on the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury, and in the 1885 general election he proposed the \"Unauthorised Programme\", which was not enacted, of benefits for newly enfranchised agricultural labourers, including the slogan promising \"three acres and a cow\".",
      "Chamberlain resigned from Gladstone's Third Government in 1886 in opposition to Irish Home Rule.",
      "He helped to engineer a Liberal Party split and became a Liberal Unionist, a party which included a bloc of MPs based in and around Birmingham.",
      "From the 1895 general election the Liberal Unionists were in coalition with the Conservative Party, under Chamberlain's former opponent Lord Salisbury.",
      "In that government Chamberlain promoted the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897.",
      "He served as Secretary of State for the Colonies, promoting a variety of schemes to build up the Empire in Asia, Africa, and the West Indies.",
      "He had major responsibility for causing the Second Boer War (1899–1902) in South Africa and was the government minister most responsible for the war effort.",
      "He became a dominant figure in the Unionist Government's re-election at the \"Khaki Election\" in 1900.",
      "In 1903, he resigned from the Cabinet to campaign for tariff reform (i.e. taxes on imports as opposed to the existing policy of free trade with no tariffs).",
      "He obtained the support of most Unionist MPs for this stance, but the Unionists suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 general election.",
      "Shortly after public celebrations of his 70th birthday in Birmingham, he was disabled by a stroke, ending his public career.",
      "Despite never becoming Prime Minister, he was one of the most important British politicians of his day, as well as a renowned orator and municipal reformer.",
      "Historian David Nicholls notes that his personality was not attractive: he was arrogant and ruthless and much hated.",
      "He never succeeded in his grand ambitions.",
      "However, he was a highly proficient grassroots organizer of democratic instincts, and played the central role in winning the Second Boer War.",
      "He is most famous for setting the agenda of British colonial, foreign, tariff and municipal policies, and for deeply splitting both major political parties."

      "His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture.",
      "In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and \"musique concrète\" works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist.",
      "Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers.",
      "He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.",
      "As a self-taught composer and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize.",
      "While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism, African-American rhythm and blues, and doo-wop music.",
      "He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar.",
      "His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, \"Freak Out!\", combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages.",
      "He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.",
      "Zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed \"Project/Object\", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.",
      "His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so, and he has been described as the \"godfather\" of comedy rock.",
      "He was a strident critic of mainstream education and organized religion, and a forthright and passionate advocate for freedom of speech, self-education, political participation and the abolition of censorship.",
      "Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he personally disapproved of drugs, but supported their decriminalization and regulation.",
      "During Zappa's lifetime, he was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while critics found it lacking emotional depth.",
      "He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and worked as an independent artist for most of his career.",
      "He remains a major influence on musicians and composers.",
      "His honors include his 1995 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the 1997 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",
      "In 2000, he was ranked number 36 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".",
      "In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him at number 71 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and in 2011 at number 22 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\"."

      "His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.",

      "Although the first duke of Suffolk had made himself rich through trade and – particularly – royal grants, this source of income dried up on his death, so John de la Pole was among the poorest of English dukes on his accession to the title in 1463.",
      "This was a circumstance which John felt acutely; on more than one occasion, he refused to come to London due to his impoverishment being such that he could not afford the costs of maintaining a retinue.",
      "As a youth, John de la Pole married twice; his first marriage was annulled, but his second marriage, to Elizabeth of York, made him the brother- in- law of two kings, Edward IV and Richard III.",

      "John de la Pole, though, generally managed to steer clear of involvement in the tumultuous events of the Wars of the Roses.",
      "Although he was politically aligned to the House of York, by virtue of his marriage, he avoided participating in the battles of the 1450s, not taking up arms until Edward IV had claimed the throne.",
      "De la Pole appears to have spent much of this period, in fact, feuding with his East Anglian neighbours, the Paston family over an inheritance – even interfering in parliamentary elections, for example, in an attempt to gain the upper hand.",
      "Suffolk did not receive major grants from Edward IV either, although de la Pole continued to support him in arms when necessary, and when Edward lost his throne in 1470, Suffolk was not trusted by the new Lancastrian regime.",

      "Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure.",
      "A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over.",
      "He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel.",
      "His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain.",

      "Whale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s.",
      "As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, \"Bride of Frankenstein\" in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career."
